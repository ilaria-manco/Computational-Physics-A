## Computational Physics - Project A
 
The project is composed of 5 modules: single.py, double.py, test_single.py test_double.py, animation.py:

- single.py: models a single pendulum and provides solutions using implicit Euler,            
             leapfrog, explicit Euler and RK4 methods

- double.py: models a double pendulum and provides solutions using the RK4 method

- test_single.py: module to test and plot solutions for the single pendulum

- test_double.py: models to test and plot solutions for the double pendulum

- animation.py: produces an animation of the double pendulum 



Note:
All variables are in natural units
